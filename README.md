# WaterWay

This project is made to sell water. Every user – that includes franchisees as well – hat to have an account which contains their information. That information is stored at a Microsoft SQL Database and used for orders. Users can see the products on sale and which franchisee those belong to. After a customer places an order from a franchisee, it can be seen at their list.
